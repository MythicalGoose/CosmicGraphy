<h1>Cosmic Graphy</h1>
<h3>Nordpool data API (Krieviņa stundai)</h3>

Cosmic Graphy is a web project built around the Nordpool energy market API, made for a school assignment. <br>
The site fetches and visualizes electricity pricing data from the Nordpool API, making it simple and cosmic-looking.  <br>

     ~Pinterest (for UI aesthetics & design ideas)
     ~Reddit (r/webdev and r/web_design communities, for insporations)
     ~Google Images (design vibes & layout ideas)
     ~Stack Overflow (Code help, debugging, and stuff like that) -- love it 💯
     ~And mostly — my own ideas & design thoughts ;)

<h2 style="font-weight: bold"> 18/04/2025 </h2>

- Commited the site web or whatever you call it 👍
- Made the header
- Made a background that has random genered stars around (aka just dots but thats what stars are)
- Made the stars have cool pulsing/fading animation
- Made the main container that will contain the chart and stuff
- Made a container for the chart
- Made the table, but still neeeds to be adjusted and some stuff added to it
- Made the containers have cool corner borders 💯

<h2 style="font-weight: bold"> 19/04/2025 </h2>

- Added hover effects for containers
- Finished the table design
- Added the data from the API to the table (it was a bit of a pain)
- Made the site look less dull - 
  * Changed how the stars generate a bit by making the sizes and animations times to be differnt<br>
  * Added shooting stars (still in progress need to tweak it a bit to look good)
  * Adjusted the colors a bit to look better
  * Added better hover effects, like when you hover over a container it blurs a bit and they move a bit
  * Added a cool line under the sub title that chages size

- That's about it
